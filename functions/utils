# display ports (dp)
# dp - Display network listening and active connections with process owner info
#
# This function wraps `netstat -tulanp` to show active TCP/UDP listening and
# connection endpoints, along with the owning user (OWNER) of each process.
#
# Features:
# - If a search term is provided (e.g., port, PID, process name), filters output via `grep`.
# - If no search term is provided, shows all active connections.
# - Parses the PID/Program column to extract the PID and map it to a username via `ps`.
# - Adds an OWNER column to the netstat output.
# - Saves the output to /tmp/dp_matches.log temporarily for counting.
#
# Usage:
#   dp               → list all network connections with owners
#   dp ssh           → filter only lines related to "ssh"
#
# Notes:
# - Requires `sudo` to access process information.
# - Cleans up temporary log file after printing match count.
